#slow ACS server responds breaks program.  Additional checks should be implmented


#######TO DO###################
##add date/time to file name

##add config rotation

##Add logging

##set hostname


##NOTES

####Cisco terminal width is only 512, so config lines longer than that
####will wrap to the next line which will cause parsing issues...update
##it seems that it doesn't cause an issue.. not sure why..

#is it better to have each line of the output in a list, or just one big single string?
#it seems that having it in a list will make it easier to iterate through and use
#regex ^ character.  UPDATE.  I'm trying the list

#on the other hand, I will need to append the file instead of just writing a new
#file each time, not the case, writelines() takes a list.. no for loop needed

###for the regex parsing, I might need to convert byte to utf-8 first!!!!
